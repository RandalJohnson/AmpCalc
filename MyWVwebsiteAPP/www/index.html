        <p class="solid">Admitted to the Union as the 35th state on June 20, 1863, West Virginia is the heart of the Appalachian Mountains.  From the lowest point of Harper's Ferry (240 feet elevation,)
         to the highest point at Spruce Knob (4,863 feet elevation), West Virginia is rich in culture and history.  West Virginia also has some of the most beautiful rivers and streams for 
        fishing and whitewater rafting.
        </p>
        <p class="solid">The people of West Virginia are proud of their heritage.  Many claim partial Native American or Scottish-Irish ancestry.  The southern half of the state is located in what's known as "The Bible Belt."
          There are numerous Christian churches unaffiliated with larger organizations located all over the state.  Most of the state is served entirely by volunteer fire departments, and there 
        are only a few paid fire departments in the state.  </p>
